Second, to extract the the current index and the daily temperatue from the iterable produced when we call <code>enumerate</code> on the five_day_forecast <code>list</code>.

You can read these nested loops as \"*for each* coworker in the acg_preferences dictionary, print a message indicating our recomendation *for each* day in our five day forecast\".
