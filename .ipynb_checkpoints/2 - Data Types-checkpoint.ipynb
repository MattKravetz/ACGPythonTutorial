Here, we will be expanding on our first tutorial by covering two more fundemental concepts of the Python programming langauge - data types, and iteration. Before we begin, please press File->Make a Copy to make a copy of this notebook. That way, you will be able to edit this code to experiment with the language features as we discuss them. "
