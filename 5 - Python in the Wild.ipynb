    "# Python in the Wild\n",
    "<sup>By Matt Kravetz</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final interactive Python tutorial!  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous tutorials, we introduced some of the core concepts of the Python programming langauge - data types, functions, iteration, and collections (specifically, the <code>list</code>, the <code>tuple</code>, and the <code>dictionary</code>.  We also learned how these different tools can be strung together to build powerful tools, such as our wonderful <code>what_to_wear_v4</code> function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this final tutorial, we're going to attempt to build a *real* version of the <code>what_to_wear</code> function.  This function will interact with public APIs to pull in real weather data, and make a recommendation based on future weather conditions.  It will tell us what we need to pack for an upcoming Roundtable trip by checking the weather forecast. We won't do it here, but this mini-app could easily be published as a Alexa Skill or as a Google Assistant action (both of which have excellent Python API's!). Cool, huh? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the tools used here are outside the scope of the previous tutorials, and may be a bit thin on explanation.  This is intentional!  As you continue to learn how to code, you will find that *searching* for information on code that you don't yet understand is the single best way to learn.  A simple Google search along the lines of \"Python [topic you don't understand]\" will almost always bring you to an excellent resource to learn more. Also, feel free to experiment!  Tear apart this function, and try running bits of it in the code cells of this notebook."

    "### Conclusion and Next Steps \n",
    "\n",
    "And there you have it!  This concludes our Python tutorial.  This last section went 0-60 pretty quickly.... but the intent is to demonstrate that Python is a versital tool worth digging your teeth into.  Although it is a [relatively] friendly and easy-to-learn language, it is not mearly a \"beginner's langauge\".  In fact, Python underpins the essential operations an uncountable number of users - from tech giants like DropBox and Google, to the quant investment powerhouses like Two Sigma and AQR, to the rapid-development cycles of Silicoln Valley start-ups, to a million side-projects from regular folks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a great skill to pick up, and I hope this tutorial inspires you to take the next steps. If you are interested in further learning, there are many, many excellent resources available on the internet. I highly reccomend Al Sweigart’s Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Sweigart’s book offers a very soft introduction to the language, and presents it in a style that is approachable for both techincal and non-technical readers. It focuses on presenting concepts through real world examples, such as manipulating Excel and Word documents. For a more in-depth discussion, Luciano Ramalho’s Fluent Python is unparalleled.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a video introduction to the language as a whole, I cannot reccomend the talks of Python Core Developer Raymond Hettinger highly enough. In particular, his What makes Python Awesome and Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python keynote talks are excellent. For a video tutorial series, YouTuber sentdex’s channel has a wealth of detailed-yet-accessible content. You can view his “Python 3 Basics Tutorial Series’ here."
